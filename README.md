1. Introduction (1-2 sentences)

The problem our idea concentrates is about women safety, specifically when they are traveling alone or in places where they feel that their safety is at jeopardy.  We employ a simple yet can be a solution for significant problems.
2. Motivation (10-12 sentences)

Globally, an estimated 736 million women—almost one in three—have been subjected to physical or sexual violence in public. These attacks mainly happen in area where there is not much of public population and where women are alone and vulnerable . If we are able to create a device that helps to warn and prevent them, safety for women will improve greatly increase.
Our solution is basically an environment monitoring system cum SOS powered by artificially trained machine model that take in surrounding parameters and carefully process it to warn or alert the user. Even though there are many SOS devices for women to use during emergency it is not as intelligent as this device as its based on a simple button press while our device is trained with many input test cases and made accurate on its own.
3. Project details (12-15 sentences)

Our solution can we divided into two parts, the monitoring device installed in the women’s any day to day use materials like a hand bag. The second part is actually an data trained ai model that can suggest police patrols places based on data received from the devices being used.

The monitoring device :
	 
a security system for women that would provide them with the ability to detect potential threats in their environment and alert them to take the necessary steps to protect themselves. The system could use facial recognition technology to identify potential attackers, analyze their behavior and alert users to any suspicious activity. It could also use voice recognition to detect any suspicious conversations or noises in the vicinity and alert users to take the necessary steps. The system could also use natural language processing to interpret conversations and detect any potentially dangerous language or threats. Finally, the system could use machine learning algorithms to continuously improve its accuracy and effectiveness in detecting potential threats.

Software and hardware used : yolo v5 – To train image datasets, NLP modules, Jetson Nana micro controller(NVIDIA), Cam modules and GPS,GSM modules.

The data model : 
	This part is the backend of the project. When an alert is triggered in the device we register the location and data. We then use a data trained model to maintain an intelligent patrol police force in order to prevent future cases of problem.
